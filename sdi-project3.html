<p>I continued my theme of a concert performed by an artist, Britney Spears. The tour conditions have now changed, and she is performing 4 days a week, and rest 3 days. Also, depending on if the show is sold out, an encore song will be added to the setlist. Another condition that exists is the fact that if the concert duration is increased from the usual 60 minutes, each song's duration will also increase, resulting in the same number of songs regardless.</p>
